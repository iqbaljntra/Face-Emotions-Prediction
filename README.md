# Face Emotions Prediction

This project focuses on predicting human emotions from facial expressions using machine learning techniques. The model analyzes facial images and classifies them into various emotion categories such as happy, sad, angry, surprised, etc.

## Features

- Preprocessing of facial images
- Building and training a convolutional neural network (CNN) model
- Predicting emotions from facial images
- Evaluating the performance of the model

## Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or any other preferred IDE

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/iqbaljntra/Face-Emotions-Prediction.git
    cd Face-Emotions-Prediction
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

2. Open the notebook file `face_emotions_prediction.ipynb` and run the cells to execute the code step-by-step.


## Data Description

The dataset contains images of faces labeled with different emotion categories. Key features include:

- `image`: The facial image data
- `emotion`: The label for the emotion expressed in the image (e.g., happy, sad, angry, surprised, etc.)

## Model Building

The model is built using the following steps:

1. Data preprocessing: Normalizing and reshaping images, encoding labels, etc.
2. Model architecture: Building a convolutional neural network (CNN) using TensorFlow/Keras.
3. Model training: Training the CNN on the facial emotion dataset.
4. Model evaluation: Evaluating the model's performance using metrics like accuracy and loss.
